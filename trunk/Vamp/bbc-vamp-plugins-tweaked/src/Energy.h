/*!
 * \brief Calculates the RMS energy and related features
 *
 * \section Outputs
 * \par RMS energy
 * The root mean square energy of the signal.
 * \par RMS energy delta
 * The difference between the RMS energy of the current frame and the last.
 * \par Moving average
 * The Xth percentile of the RMS energy within a window.
 * \par Dip probability
 * The ratio of frames that have dipped below the dip threshold within the
 * averaging window, where the threshold is a product of the moving average.
 * \par Low energy ratio
 * Percentage of frames in the file whose energy falls below a threshold, which
 * is a product of the overall mean energy.
 *
 * \section Parameters
 * \par Use root
 * Whether to apply the square root in RMS calculation. (default = 1)
 * \par Moving average window size
 * The size of the averaging window, in seconds. (default = 1.0)
 * \par Moving average percentile
 * The percentile used to calculate the average. (default = 3.0)
 * \par Dip threshold
 * The threshold for calculating the dip, which is multiplied by the moving
 * average. (default = 3.0)
 * \par Low energy threshold
 * The threshold for calculating low energy, which is multiplied by the overall
 * mean RMS energy (default = 1.0)
 *
 * \section Description
 *
 * <b>RMS energy</b> for each block is calculated as follows. The square root
 * can be removed using the 'Use root' parameter (default = true)
 * \f[ RMS = \sqrt{\displaystyle\sum\limits_{i=0}^n x_i^2} \f]
 *
 * The <b>dip threshold</b> is a simple but effective speech/music
 * discriminator. It is defined as the ratio of frames in a moving window which
 * fall below a threshold, where the threshold is a product of the moving
 * average.
 *
 * The <b>low energy ratio</b> is the percentage of blocks which fall below
 * a certain RMS energy threshold. The threshold is set using the 'Low energy
 * threshold' parameter which is a ratio of the overall mean RMS energy (default = 1).
